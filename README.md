Gensim provides platform to train word embedding on your custom data. Please follow following steps.

- Create Virtual Environment
  ```
  virtualenv --python=<your python path> <name_env>

  ```
- Activate the Environment
 ```
  source <name of environment>/bin/activate

 ```
- Install the requirements.
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
- Make sure you have made an .env file with PROJECT_PATH, MODEL_NAME, LANGUAGE (language of text you are training) and path of your data file.

 Your data should be a text file with clean, preprocessed texts, a sentence per line.

- Now, train by running the run file.
